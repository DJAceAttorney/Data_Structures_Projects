# Data_Structures_Projects
Designed programs using different data structures such as: Linked Lists, Stacks, Heaps, Queues, Binary Trees, Hash Tables, etc.

# Maze Solving
Used a linked list data structure to implement a stack. The program solves given maze files using recursion and backtracking to find the correct path and stores it in a vector. If there is no solution the program returns an empty vector.  

# Range Average Query
Implemented two different solutions for the Range Average Query problem, each with a different asymptotic running time. The two implementations were Dynamic Programming and Block Decomposition

# Treaps (Binary Trees)
Constructed and used binary search trees and wrote a tree rebalancing algorithm (single rotations). The tree had to keep the Max-Heap Property throughout the entire program.
